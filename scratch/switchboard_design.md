Okay, here are my thoughts on designing the Azure OpenAI load balancing library, from an SRE perspective. I'll focus on reliability, performance, observability, and operational simplicity.

**Overall Design Principles (Reinforcing what you've already outlined):**

*   **Simplicity:** Absolutely paramount.  Avoid unnecessary abstractions.  The core logic should be easy to understand and reason about.  Fewer moving parts mean fewer things to break.
*   **Performance:**  Minimize overhead.  We're dealing with LLM inference, which is already latency-sensitive.  The load balancer shouldn't add significant delays.
*   **Observability:**  Assume this *will* fail, and design for debugging from the start.  Metrics, tracing, and structured logging are critical.
*   **Azure-Native:**  Leverage Azure's existing features where possible (e.g., health probes, connection pooling if the `AsyncAzureOpenAI` client handles it).  Don't reinvent the wheel.
*   **Testability:**  Design for unit and integration testing.  This will force a clean API and help catch regressions.
*   **Coordination-Free:** A good starting point.  Avoids the complexity of distributed consensus.  Power-of-two-choices is a solid algorithm.
* **OpenTelemetry First:** Design for OpenTelemetry from the beginning.

**API Design and Core Components:**

1.  **`AzureOpenAILoadBalancer` (Main Class):**

    *   **Constructor:**
        *   Takes a list of Azure OpenAI deployment configurations.  Each configuration should include:
            *   `deployment_name` (string, e.g., "my-gpt4-deployment")
            *   `api_base` (string, the Azure OpenAI endpoint URL)
            *   `api_key` (string, the Azure OpenAI API key)
            *   `api_version` (string, e.g., "2023-05-15")
            *   `max_retries` (int, optional, default: 3)
            *   `timeout` (float, optional, default: 60 seconds)
            *   `max_rpm` (int, optional, for client-side rate limiting)
            *   `max_tpm` (int, optional, for client-side rate limiting)
            *   `weight` (int, optional, default: 1, for weighted random selection if desired)
        *   Optional: `health_check_interval` (float, default: 10 seconds) - How often to run health checks.
        *   Optional: `cooldown_period` (float, default: 60 seconds) - How long to mark a deployment as unhealthy after a failure.
        *   Optional: `sticky_session_duration` (float, default: 600 seconds/10 minutes) - How long to prefer a deployment for a session.
        *   Optional: `telemetry_prefix` (string, default: "aoai_lb") -  Prefix for metric names.
    *   **`chat_completion(messages, model, ...)` (Async Method):**  Mirrors the `openai.ChatCompletion.acreate` method (and other relevant methods like `completions`, `embeddings`, etc.).  This is the primary entry point for users.
        *   Takes the same parameters as the OpenAI client's `acreate` method.
        *   Adds a `session_id` parameter (optional `str` or `UUID`).  If provided, the load balancer will attempt to use the same deployment for subsequent requests with the same `session_id`.
        *   Returns a `ChatCompletion` object (or stream) just like the OpenAI client.
        *   Handles retries, failover, and health checks internally.
        *   Raises an exception (e.g., `LoadBalancerError`) if all deployments fail after retries.
    *   **`close()` (Async Method):**  Shuts down background tasks (health checks) and releases resources.
    *   **Internal Attributes (not directly exposed):**
        *   `_deployments`: A list of `Deployment` objects (see below).
        *   `_health_checker`: An instance of the `HealthChecker` class (see below).
        *   `_session_map`: A dictionary mapping `session_id` to `deployment_name`.  Could use an LRU cache (e.g., `aiocache.LRU`) to automatically expire old sessions.
        *   `_metrics`: An instance of a `Metrics` class (see below).

2.  **`Deployment` (Internal Class):**

    *   Represents a single Azure OpenAI deployment.
    *   **Attributes:**
        *   All the configuration parameters from the constructor (e.g., `deployment_name`, `api_base`, `api_key`, etc.).
        *   `is_healthy` (boolean):  Tracked by the `HealthChecker`.
        *   `last_error_time` (float):  Timestamp of the last error.  Used for cooldown.
        *   `_client`: An instance of `openai.AsyncAzureOpenAI` (or `openai.AsyncOpenAI` if supporting non-Azure endpoints).  Initialized lazily on first use.  This handles connection pooling.
        *   `_request_count`: (int) Number of requests currently being processed.
        *   `_last_request_time`: (float) Timestamp of the last request.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   `create_chat_completion(...)`:  A thin wrapper around the `AsyncAzureOpenAI` client's `acreate` method.  Handles retries *for this specific deployment*.
        *   `health_check()`:  Sends a simple health check request (e.g., a completion with a short prompt).

3.  **`HealthChecker` (Internal Class):**

    *   Runs in a background task.
    *   Periodically calls the `health_check()` method on each `Deployment`.
    *   Updates the `is_healthy` and `last_error_time` attributes of the `Deployment` objects.
    *   Uses a circuit breaker pattern:
        *   If a deployment fails a health check, mark it as unhealthy (`is_healthy = False`).
        *   After the `cooldown_period`, mark it as healthy again (`is_healthy = True`).
        *   Consider using a "half-open" state for more sophisticated circuit breaking (not strictly necessary for MVP).

4.  **`Metrics` (Internal Class):**

    *   Uses OpenTelemetry.
    *   Tracks:
        *   `aoai_lb.request_duration`: Histogram of request durations (TTFB, total time).  Labels: `deployment_name`, `model`, `status` ("success", "error"), `session_id`.
        *   `aoai_lb.requests`: Counter of total requests.  Labels: `deployment_name`, `model`, `status`.
        *   `aoai_lb.errors`: Counter of total errors.  Labels: `deployment_name`, `model`, `error_type`.
        *   `aoai_lb.deployment_health`: Gauge (0 or 1) indicating deployment health.  Labels: `deployment_name`.
        *   `aoai_lb.tokens`: Counter of total tokens (input + output). Labels: `deployment_name`, `model`.
        *   `aoai_lb.cached_tokens`: Counter of cached tokens. Labels: `deployment_name`, `model`.
        *   `aoai_lb.rpm_utilization`: Gauge of RPM utilization (if `max_rpm` is configured).  Labels: `deployment_name`.
        *   `aoai_lb.tpm_utilization`: Gauge of TPM utilization (if `max_tpm` is configured).  Labels: `deployment_name`.
        *   `aoai_lb.session_hit`: Counter. Labels: `deployment_name`, `hit` (boolean, whether the session was a hit or miss).
    *   Provides methods for recording these metrics.

5. **`LoadBalancerError` (Custom Exception):**
    *   Raised when all deployments fail after retries.
    *   Includes information about the errors encountered.

**Load Balancing Logic (Inside `AzureOpenAILoadBalancer.chat_completion`)**

1.  **Session Stickiness:**
    *   If `session_id` is provided, check `_session_map` for an existing deployment.
    *   If found, and the deployment is healthy, use it.
    *   If not found, or the deployment is unhealthy, proceed to step 2.

2.  **Deployment Selection:**
    *   Filter the `_deployments` list to include only healthy deployments.
    *   If no healthy deployments, raise `LoadBalancerError`.
    *   Use power-of-two-choices:
        *   Randomly select two deployments.
        *   Choose the one with the lower `_request_count` (or a weighted combination of `_request_count` and `last_request_time` if you want to incorporate recency).
    *   If `session_id` is provided, add/update the `_session_map`.

3.  **Request Execution:**
    *   Call the selected `Deployment` object's `create_chat_completion` method.
    *   Record metrics (latency, success/failure, token counts, etc.).
    *   If the request fails:
        *   Increment the deployment's error count.
        *   Mark the deployment as unhealthy (the `HealthChecker` will handle cooldown).
        *   Remove the deployment from `_session_map` (if applicable).
        *   Retry the request with a different deployment (up to `max_retries`).
    *   If the request succeeds:
        *   Update the deployment's `_last_request_time`.

**Retries and Timeouts:**

*   **Deployment-Level Retries:**  The `Deployment.create_chat_completion` method handles retries *for that specific deployment*.  Use `tenacity` for this.  Configure retries for specific exceptions (e.g., connection errors, timeouts, 5xx status codes).
*   **Load Balancer-Level Retries:**  The `AzureOpenAILoadBalancer.chat_completion` method handles retries *across different deployments*.  If one deployment fails (after its internal retries), try another.
*   **Timeouts:**  Set timeouts at both levels (deployment and load balancer).  The load balancer's timeout should be slightly longer than the deployment's timeout.

**Rate Limiting:**

*   **Client-Side Rate Limiting:**  If `max_rpm` and `max_tpm` are provided in the deployment configuration, use a token bucket algorithm (e.g., `aiolimiter`) to limit requests *before* sending them to Azure.  This is optional but can help prevent exceeding your Azure quotas.
*   **Azure-Side Rate Limiting:**  Azure OpenAI already has rate limits.  Handle 429 (Too Many Requests) errors gracefully (retry with backoff).

**Testing:**

*   **Unit Tests:**  Test individual components (e.g., `Deployment`, `HealthChecker`, `Metrics`, power-of-two-choices logic).  Mock the `AsyncAzureOpenAI` client.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire load balancer with actual Azure OpenAI deployments (or mocked deployments that simulate errors and latency).  Verify:
    *   Load distribution.
    *   Failover.
    *   Session stickiness.
    *   Health checks.
    *   Metrics.
    *   Rate limiting.

**Example Usage (Conceptual):**

```python
from my_aoai_loadbalancer import AzureOpenAILoadBalancer

deployments = [
    {
        "deployment_name": "gpt4-eastus",
        "api_base": "https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/",
        "api_key": "YOUR_KEY_1",
        "api_version": "2023-05-15",
        "max_rpm": 300,
        "max_tpm": 250000,
    },
    {
        "deployment_name": "gpt4-westus",
        "api_base": "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/",
        "api_key": "YOUR_KEY_2",
        "api_version": "2023-05-15",
        "max_rpm": 300,
        "max_tpm": 250000,
    },
]

lb = AzureOpenAILoadBalancer(deployments, health_check_interval=5, cooldown_period=30)

async def main():
  try:
    response = await lb.chat_completion(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}],
        model="gpt-4",
        session_id="my-session",
    )
    print(response)

    # Subsequent requests with the same session_id will try to use the same deployment
    response2 = await lb.chat_completion(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"}],
        model="gpt-4",
        session_id="my-session",
    )
    print(response2)

  except LoadBalancerError as e:
    print(f"All deployments failed: {e}")

  finally:
      await lb.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())

```

**Key Improvements over LiteLLM:**

*   **Simplicity:**  Much less code and fewer layers of abstraction.
*   **Azure-Focused:**  Optimized for Azure OpenAI, avoiding unnecessary generalization.
*   **Performance:**  Lower overhead due to reduced complexity and lazy initialization.
*   **Observability:**  Built-in OpenTelemetry integration for detailed metrics and tracing.
*   **Control:**  More fine-grained control over retries, timeouts, and health checks.
*   **Maintainability:** Easier to understand, debug, and extend.

This detailed design should provide a solid foundation for building a robust and performant Azure OpenAI load balancer. Remember to prioritize simplicity and observability throughout the implementation process.
